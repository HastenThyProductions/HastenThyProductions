## Welcome!

Thank you for visiting! I'm Hasten, a newbie game developer who's learning the ropes.
Unfortunately I can't quit my dayjob yet, so learning and practice time isn't ideal, 
but I'm having fun with it and hope to bring some content to you all in the near future!


### Goals

With ambition cranked up to 11, I want to learn every aspect of being a game dev. 
From the art, storyboarding, and worldbuilding. To mechanics, coding, music, and sound design.
I'm open to any suggestions and all criticisms and critiques of my work. So if you have something
to say about something I've posted (positive or negative) please let me know!
I would love to discuss about how something can be changed or improved!



### Accounts

If you would like to follow along with my progress, I like to upload my concept arts and game testing
to Instagram [@HastenThyProductions.](https://www.instagram.com/hastenthyproductions/)

I also hope to upload my future projects to itch.io, so please support me there if you enjoy my work!
